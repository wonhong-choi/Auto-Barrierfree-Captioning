1
00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.480
Water is virtually everywhere,

2
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.640
from soil moisture and ice caps to the cells inside our own bodies.

3
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.780
Depending on factors like location, fat index, age, and sex,

4
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.240
the average human is between 55 and 60% water.

5
00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.980
At birth, human babies are even wetter.

6
00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.720
Being 75% water, they are swimmingly similar to fish,

7
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.900
but their water composition drops to 65% by their first birthday.

8
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.780
So what role does water play in our bodies,

9
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.060
and how much do we actually need to drink to stay healthy?

10
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.400
The H2O in our bodies works to cushion and lubricate joints,

11
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.720
regulate temperature, and to nourish the brain and spinal cord.

12
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.740
Water isn't only in our blood.

13
00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.080
An adult's brain and heart are almost three quarters water.

14
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.780
That's roughly equivalent to the amount of moisture in a banana.

15
00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.540
Lungs are more similar to an apple at 83%,

16
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.320
and even seemingly dry human bones are 31% water.

17
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.540
If we are essentially made of water and surrounded by water,

18
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.840
why do we still need to drink so much?

19
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.320
Well, each day we lose two to three liters

20
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.340
through our sweat, urine, and bowel movements,

21
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:27.800
and even just from breathing.

22
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.740
While these functions are essential to our survival,

23
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.040
we need to compensate for the fluid loss.

24
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.700
Maintaining a balanced water level is essential to avoid dehydration

25
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.180
or over-hydration,

26
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.700
both of which can have devastating effects on overall health.

27
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.400
At first detection of low water levels,

28
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.560
sensory receptors in the brain's hypothalamus

29
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.320
signal the release of antidiuretic hormone.

30
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.860
When it reaches the kidneys, it creates aquaporins,

31
00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.100
special channels that enable blood to absorb and retain more water,

32
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.360
leading to concentrated dark urine.

33
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.360
Increased dehydration can cause notable drops in energy, mood,

34
00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.699
skin moisture, and blood pressure,

35
00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.440
as well as signs of cognitive impairment.

36
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.220
A dehydrated brain works harder to accomplish the same amount as a normal brain,

37
00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.100
and it even temporarily shrinks because of its lack of water.

38
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.460
Over-hydration, or hyponatremia,

39
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.060
is usually caused by over-consumption of water in a short amount of time.

40
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.200
Athletes are often the victims of over-hydration

41
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.560
because of complications in regulating water levels

42
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.580
in extreme physical conditions.

43
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.600
Whereas the dehydrated brain amps up the production of antidiuretic hormone,

44
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.640
the over-hydrated brain slows or even stops releasing it into the blood.

45
00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.500
Sodium electrolytes in the body become diluted, causing cells to swell.

46
00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.360
In severe cases, the kidneys can't keep up with the resulting volumes of dilute urine.

47
00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.260
Water intoxication then occurs, possibly causing headache, vomiting,

48
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.660
and in rare instances, seizures or death.

49
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.960
But that's a pretty extreme situation.

50
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.040
On a normal day-to-day basis,

51
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.480
maintaining a well-hydrated system is easy to manage

52
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.020
for those of us fortunate enough to have access to clean drinking water.

53
00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.660
For a long time, conventional wisdom said that we should drink eight glasses a day.

54
00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.380
That estimate has since been fine-tuned.

55
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.300
Now, the consensus is that the amount of water we need to imbibe

56
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.680
depends largely on our weight and environment.

57
00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.360
The recommended daily intake varies,

58
00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.560
from between 2.5 to 3.7 liters of water for men

59
00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.540
and about 2 to 2.7 liters for women,

60
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:49.220
a range that is pushed up or down if we are healthy, active, old, or overheating.

61
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.540
While water is the healthiest hydrator,

62
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.260
other beverages, even those with caffeine like coffee or tea,

63
00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.940
replenish fluids as well.

64
00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.040
And water within food makes up about a fifth of our daily H2O intake.

65
00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.580
Fruits and vegetables like strawberries, cucumbers, and even broccoli

66
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.680
are over 90% water and can supplement liquid intake

67
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.560
while providing valuable nutrients and fiber.

68
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.220
Drinking well might also have various long-term benefits.

69
00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.579
Studies have shown that optimal hydration can lower the chance of stroke,

70
00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.160
help manage diabetes,

71
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.060
and potentially reduce the risk of certain types of cancer.

72
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.360
No matter what, getting the right amount of liquid

73
00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.700
makes a world of difference in how you'll feel, think, and function day to day.
